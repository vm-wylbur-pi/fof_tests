# This file contains a structure list of audio files that the experiences (games")
# run through the GSA use. These files should be loaded onto all the flowers.
#
# All paths here are relative to the root folder of the SD filesystem.
#
# Schema:
#  At the top level, this is a dict keyed by game name. The structure within each
#  game is not specified and all that matters is that the file matches what that
#  game code expects.

Fairy:
  # A dict from fairy name to the set of giggle sounds for each fairy.
  # Any one fairy instance is a randomly chosen fairy and will randomly choose
  # giggle sounds only from under that fairy name.

    # is preferable to computed filenames, since it leaves us more flexibility
